# Snake_Game
This project is a local single/double-player game with a snake moving around the board, eating apples and gaining points. One point is awarded for each apple that is eaten by the snake and at intervals of 10 apples, the speed increases. The player controls their snake using WASD keys in order to get as many points as possible while avoiding the boundary and themselves. In the multiplayer mode, two players control their own snake and try to outlast each other.
